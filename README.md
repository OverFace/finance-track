# MyFinTrack

This repository provides the folder structure for a customizable finance analysis and recommendation system. The project is organized into several modules to support future development of features such as:

1. **User authentication and asset input pipeline** (`myfintrack/auth`)
2. **Unified asset dashboard** (`myfintrack/dashboard`)
3. **Rebalancing analysis and alerts** (`myfintrack/rebalancing`)
4. **Financial product analysis and recommendations** (`myfintrack/recommendation`)
5. **Financial news and market data collection** (`myfintrack/news` and `myfintrack/data`)

Each module currently contains placeholder files where implementation can be added.
